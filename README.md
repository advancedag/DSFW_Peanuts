# DSFW_Peanuts
Analysis of peanut DSFW from USDA-NASS databases.

This repository contains an R script for downloading, analyzing, and vizualizing Days Suitable for Field Work (DSFW) in 11 peanut producing states.  This script was authored by Terry Griffin at Kansas State University and was used to develop a publication co-authored by Jason Ward at NC State University.  R version 3.4.2 was used at time of development.

The goal is to create R Markdown to associate with this script.
