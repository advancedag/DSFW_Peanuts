# DSFW_Peanuts

This repository contains an R script (peanuts.R) for downloading, analyzing, and vizualizing Days Suitable for Field Work (DSFW) in 11 peanut producing states.  This script connects directly to source databases via API connection and requires no local data files.  

This script was authored by Terry Griffin at Kansas State University and was used to develop a publication co-authored by Jason Ward at NC State University.  

R version 3.4.2 was used at time of development.

The goal is to create R Markdown to associate with this script.  Please check back.
